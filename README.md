**Introduction**
In the contemporary landscape of urban living, where efficiency and convenience are paramount, the need for seamless transportation solutions has become increasingly evident.
The Online Cab Booking System project in PHP with MySQL emerges as a practical and responsive solution to address the challenges associated with traditional cab booking services.
This project endeavors to streamline the process of booking, managing, and tracking cabs in real-time, catering to the dynamic requirements of both clients and service providers.
**Purpose**
The primary purpose of the Online Cab Booking System is to offer a user-friendly, online platform that revolutionizes the way individuals access and manage transportation services. 
By leveraging the power of PHP and MySQL, this project aims to overcome the limitations of conventional cab booking systems, providing a more efficient and accessible means for clients to 
secure transportation and for drivers to manage their bookings.
**Technologies Used**
The development of the Online Cab Booking System in PHP with MySQL involves a carefully selected stack of technologies to ensure robust functionality, security, and scalability. The project leverages the following technologies and frameworks:
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)
PHP serves as the primary server-side scripting language. Its versatility and compatibility with web servers make it ideal for dynamic web page development and server-side scripting, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive features within the cab booking system.
MySQL Database
	MySQL is employed as the relational database management system (RDBMS) for the project. It provides a robust and scalable platform for storing and managing data related to clients, drivers, bookings, and system configurations. The structured nature of MySQL facilitates efficient data retrieval and management.
HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language)
	HTML5 is utilized for structuring the content of web pages. It plays a fundamental role in creating a well-organized and semantically structured user interface, ensuring compatibility across various browsers and devices.
CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets)
	CSS3 is employed for styling and layout purposes. It enhances the visual appeal of the web application, providing a consistent and aesthetically pleasing user experience. CSS3 also contributes to responsive design, ensuring optimal display on different screen sizes.
JavaScript
	JavaScript is used to enhance the interactivity and responsiveness of the web application. It facilitates dynamic updates, form validation, and asynchronous communication between the client and server, contributing to a more seamless user experience.
Bootstrap Framework
	The Bootstrap framework is integrated to streamline the development of responsive and mobile-friendly user interfaces. Its pre-built components and responsive design utilities expedite the creation of a visually appealing and accessible web application.
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
	AJAX is employed to enable asynchronous communication between the client and server. This technology enhances the user experience by allowing real-time updates without the need for page reloads, particularly beneficial for dynamic features like live tracking.
jQuery
	jQuery is used to simplify DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX interactions. Its lightweight nature and extensive library of plugins contribute to efficient front-end development.
